## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `data_structures/`: In-depth notes and examples for Python data structures like lists, sets, dicts, etc.
- `algorithms/`: Core algorithm concepts including sorting, searching, recursion, and more.
- `leetcode_solutions/`: Organized solutions by difficulty level for popular DSA problems.
- `resources/`: Cheatsheets, summaries, and external references to aid learning.
