# Tuples in Python

Tuples are immutable ordered collections. Once created, their elements cannot be changed.

## Creating a Tuple
```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
single = (1,)
```

## Accessing Elements
```python
t[0]  # 1
```

## Use Cases
- Returning multiple values from a function
- Fixed data structures
- Dictionary keys (tuples are hashable)
